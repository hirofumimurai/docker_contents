# Examining the Scripures Dialy


Let us be putting up with one another , forgive one another freely. Because Jehova forgave us ,so we have to do the same.-Cor.3:13

Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely...Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,you must also do the same.-Col.3:13
